## NetBIOS
The NetBIOS service listens on TCP port 139, as well as several UDP ports. It should be ntoed that SMB (TCP port 445) and NetBIOS are two separate protocols.

NetBIOS is an independent session layer protocol and service that allows computers on a local network to communicate with each other. While modern implementations of SMBcan work without NetBIOS, NetBIOS over TCP (NBT) is required for backward compatibility and is often enabled together, hence the enumeration of these two services often goes hand-in-hand.

We can use nmap to do so.
```bash
nmap -v -p 139,445 -oG smb.txt 10.11.1.1-254
```

There are other more specialized tools for specifically identifying NetBIOS information, such as **nbtscan**, which is used as follows. The **-r** option is used to specify the originating UDP port as 137, which is used to query the NetBIOS name service for valid NetBIOS names.
```bash
sudo nbtscan -r 10.11.1.0/24
```

## NSE scripts
There are many useful NSE scripts for enumerating and discovering SMB services.
```bash
ls -1 /usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb*
```

The **smb-os-discovery** module is one example, which can identify a potential match for the host operating system.
```bash
nmap -v -p 139, 445 --script=smb-os-discovery 10.11.1.227
```

We can also use the **smb-vuln-ms08-067**, which uses the **--script-args** option to pass arguments to the script.
```bash
nmap -v -p 139,445 --script=smb-vuln-ms08-067 --script-args=unsafe=1 10.11.1.5
```
This script can identify if the SMB service is missing at least one critical patch for the MS08-067 vulnerability.

## Blanket command for vulnerability detection
By design, nmap comes with various scripts that can be used to detect various vulnerabilities or CVEs. Specifically for SMB, we can use nmap to detect below CVEs:

-   2009-3103
-   2017-7494
-   ms06-025
-   ms07-029
-   ms08-067
-   ms10-054
-   ms10-061
-   ms17-010 (Eternal Blue)

All these vulnerabilities can be detected using single nmap command.
```bash
nmap --script smb-vuln-conficker.nse,smb-vuln-cve2009-3103.nse,smb-vuln-cve-2017-7494.nse,smb-vuln-ms06-025.nse,smb-vuln-ms07-029.nse,smb-vuln-ms08-067.nse,smb-vuln-ms10-054.nse,smb-vuln-ms10-061.nse,smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse,smb-vuln-regsvc-dos.nse,smb-vuln-webexec.nse -p445 192.168.157.52
```

## Topical Exercises
1.  Use Nmap to make a list of the SMB servers in the lab that are running Windows.
```bash
sudo nmap -p 139,445 192.168.157.1-254 -oG smbscan
```

2.  Use NSE scripts to scan these systems for SMB vulnerabilities.

3.  Use nbtscan and enum4linux against these systems to identify the types of data you can obtain from different versions of Windows.
