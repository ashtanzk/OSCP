## TCP/UDP Scanning

### TCP Scanning
The simplest TCP scanning technique (CONNECT Scan) relies on the three-way handshake mechanism (SYN > SYN-ACK > ACK)
```bash
nc -nvv -w 1 -z 10.11.1.220 3388-3390
```

### UDP Scanning
Since UDP is stateless, the mechanism of UDP scanning does not involve the three-way handshake. Some UDP scanners make use of the message "ICMP port unreachable" to infer the status of the UDP port, but this is unreliable due to the possible presence of a firewall which would not relay such a message, causing the scanner to report the port as open falsely.
```bash
nc -nv -u -z -w 1 10.11.1.115 160-162
```

## Using Nmap:
### Stealth/SYN Scan
This is the default scan technique of nmap, where SYN packets are sent to various ports on a target machine. If the port is open, a SYN-ACK packet will be sent back from the target, reducing the need for the final ACK to be sent to complete the three-way handshake
```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.11.1.220
```

### TCP Connect Scan
When nmap is run without raw socket privileges, Nmap will default to TCP connect scan, which performs the three-way handshake. Since Nmap needs to wait for the connection to complete, the TCP connect scan will take much longer than the SYN scan.
```bash
nmap -sT 10.11.1.220
```

### UDP Scanning
Nmap uses a combination of two methods to determine if a port is open or closed. It will use the standard "ICMP port unreachable" method for most ports by sending an empty packet to the port. 
However, for common ports like port 161 (SNMP), it will send a protocol specific SNMP packet in an attempt to get a response from the application bound to that port.
```bash
sudo nmap -sU 10.11.1.115
```

The UDP scan (-sU) can also be used in conjunction with a TCP SYN scan (-sS) option to build a more complete picture of our target:
```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.11.1.115
```

### Network Sweeping
For large volumes of hosts, we can use *Network Sweeping* technqiues which go from broad scans before using more specific scans on hosts of interest.
```bash
nmap -sn 10.11.1.1-254
```

We can use the greppable output parameter to get the results in an easier to manage format.
```bash
nmap -v -sn 10.11.1.1-254 -oG ping-sweep.txt
grep Up ping-sweep.txt | cut -d " " -f 2
```

We can sweep for specific TCP or UDP ports across the network (common services and ports).
```bash
nmap -p 80 10.11.1.1-254 -oG web-sweep.txt
grep open web-sweep.txt | cut -d" " -f2
```

We can also scan multiple IPs, probing for a list of common ports. For example, let's conduct a _TCP connect scan_ for the top twenty TCP ports with the **--top-ports** option and enable OS version detection, script scanning, and traceroute with **-A**.
```bash
nmap -sT -A --top-ports=20 10.11.1.1-254 -oG top-port-sweep.txt
```

### OS Fingerprinting
We can use the **-o** flag to guess the target's operating system.
```bash
sudo nmap -O 10.11.1.220
```

### Banner Grabbing/Service Enumeration
We can also identify services running on specific ports by inspecting service banners (**-sV**) and running various OS and service enumeration scripts (**â€“A**) against the target.
```bash
nmap -sV -sT -A 10.11.1.220
```

### Scanning from input file
We can pass an input file containing a list of hosts to scan using (**-iL**).
```bash
nmap -p 80 -iL <inputfilename>
```
### Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
We can also use the NSE to launch user-created scripts to automate various scanning tasks such as DNS enumeration, brute force attacks, and even vulnerability detection. The NSE scripts are located in the **/usr/share/nmap/scripts** directory.
```bash
# smb-os-discovery script attempts to connect to the SMB service on a target system and determine its operating system
nmap 10.11.1.220 --script=smb-os-discovery

# dns-zone-transfer script
nmap --script=dns-zone-transfer -p 53 ns2.megacorpone.com

# can get more information about a script
nmap --script-help dns-zone-transfer
```

## Masscan
Masscan is a very fast port scanner which was originally designed to scan the entire Internet, hence it can easily handle a class A or B subnet during a penetration test.

This tool is not installed on Kali by default, so it must be installed by **sudo apt install masscan**
```bash
sudo apt install masscan
```

You can use masscan to scan an internal network to look for machines with the port 80 open.
```bash
sudo masscan -p80 10.0.0.0/8
```

To try masscan on a class C submet in the PWK Internal Lab network, we need to add a few additional **masscan** options: **--rate** to specify the desired rate of packet transmission, **-e** to specify the raw network interface to use, and **--router-ip** to specify the IP address for the appropriate gateway
```bash
sudo masscan -p80 10.11.1.0/24 --rate=1000 -e tap0 --router-ip 10.11.0.1
```

## Topical Exercises

### Exercise 1:
Use Nmap to conduct a ping sweep of your target IP range and save the output to a file. Use grep to show machines that are online.

### Exercise 2:
Scan the IP addresses you found in exercise 1 for open webserver ports. Use Nmap to find the webserver and operating system versions.

### Exercise 3:
Use NSE scripts to scan the machines in the labs that are running the SMB service.

### Exercise 4:
Use Wireshark to capture a Nmap connect and UDP scan and compare it against the Netcat port scans. Are they the same or different?

- They are the same. The nc scan requires the three way handshake to be completed, same as the Nmap Connect scan.

Nmap UDP Scan:

### Exercise 5:
Use Wireshark to capture a Nmap SYN scan and compare it to a connect scan and identify the difference between them.

- The Nmap SYN scan does not require the three-way handshake to be completed.
