# Identifying Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities
We can look for Directory Traversal vulnerabilities, which reside in the URL query strings and form bodies in search of values that **appear as file references**. One common indicator is file extensions in URL query strings.

Once we have identified a directory traversal vulnerability, we can attempt to read files from the victim's machine, such as `/etc/passwd` on Linux, or `c:/boot.ini` on Windows.

Using our Windows 10 Lab Machine as the web application, we can see when we browse to the Menu page, the URL queries a file 'current_menu.php'. This file extension could be indicative of a potential directory traversal vulnerability.

Changing the URL to query 'old.php', we see that there is an error message stating that the file failed to open. We can try to navigate to other important files to read.

We try to read the **hosts** files of the system using the following URL query.
````
http://192.168.164.10/menu.php?file=c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
