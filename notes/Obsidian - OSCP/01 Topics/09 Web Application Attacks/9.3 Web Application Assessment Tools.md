# DIRB
DIRB is a web content scanner that uses a wordlist to find directories and pages by issuing requests to the server.

By default, it will identify interesting directories on the server, but it can also be customised to search for specific directories, use custom dictionaries, set a custom cookie or header on each request, etc.

```bash
# -r makes the scan non-recursive, hence it only looks for top level directories
dirb http://www.megacorpone.com -r -z 10
```

# Burp Suite
Burp Suite Community is installed in Kali. We can use the *Proxy* tool to intercept the requests sent from the browser, allowing us to change the request parameters. The *Repeater* tool allows us to repeatedly send multiple requests to the server.


# Nikto
Nikto is a highly configurable Open Source web server scanner that tests for thousands of dangerous files and programs, vulnerable server versions and various server configuration issues. While it is powerful, it is not designed for stealth as it sends many requests and embeds information about itself in the *User-Agent* header.

Since it scans many pages, the scans may take a very long time to complete. The `-maxtime` option stops the scan after the specified limit. `-T` allows us to tune the scan - what tests we want to run, etc.

```bash
nikto -host=http://www.megacorpone.com -maxtime=30s
```
