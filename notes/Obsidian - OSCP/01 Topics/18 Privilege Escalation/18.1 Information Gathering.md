# Manual Information Gathering
With manual information gathering, it can be time consuming, but it can allow for more control and help identify certain methods which may be missed by automation tools.

There are several types of information that we can enumerate:
- [[#Enumerating Users]]
- [[#Enumerating Hostname]]
- [[#Enumerating OS version and architecture]]
- [[#Enumerating Running processes and services]]
- [[#Enumerating Networking information]]
- [[#Enumerating Firewall status and rules]]
- [[#Enumerating Scheduled tasks]]
- [[#Enumerating Installed applications and patch levels]]
- [[#Enumerating Readable/writable files and directories]]
- [[#Enumerating Unmounted disks]]
- [[#Enumerating Device drivers and kernel modules]]
- [[#Enumerating Binaries that autoelevate]]

### Enumerating Users
```bash
# Windows and Linux
whoami

# Windows
net user # To discover other user accounts
net user <USER> # To gather more information about specified user

# Linux
id # Gathering user context information
cat /etc/passwd # Reveals other users
```

### Enumerating Hostname
```bash
# Windows and Linux
hostname
```

### Enumerating OS version and architecture
```bash
# Windows
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version" /C:"System Type"

# Linux
cat /etc/issue # OS version
cat /etc/*-release # OS version
uname -a # Kernel version and architecture
```

### Enumerating Running processes and services
```bash
# Windows
tasklist /SVC

# Linux
ps axu
```

### Enumerating Networking information
```bash
# Winodws
ipconfig /all
route print
netstat -ano # All active TCP connections, Numerical address and port, Owner PID of each connection

# Linux
ifconfig
ip a
/sbin/route
ss -anp # All connections, Avoid hostname resolution, Process the connection belongs to
```

### Enumerating Firewall status and rules
```bash
# Windows
netsh advfirewall show currentprofile
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all

# Linux
iptables # May require root, but can gain information from other files
cd /etc/iptables # Firewall rules saved by the system, possibly with weak permissions
```

### Enumerating Scheduled tasks
```bash
# Windows
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v

# Linux
ls -lah /etc/cron*
cat /etc/crontab # Sys admins often add their own scripts > look for insecure file permissions (jobs running as root)
```

### Enumerating Installed applications and patch levels
```bash
# Windows
wmic product get name, version, vendor # Listing all installed applications
wmic qfe get Caption, Description, HotFixID, InstalledOn # Checking system-wide updates

# Linux
dpkg -l # Listing all installed applications
```

### Enumerating Readable/writable files and directories
```bash
# Windows
accesschk.exe -uws "Everyone" "C:\Program Files"

# Windows Powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files" -Recurse | Get-ACL | ?{$_.AccessToString -match "Everyone\sAllow\s\sModify"}

# Linux
find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null
```

### Enumerating Unmounted disks
```bash
# It may be easy to forget about unmounted disks which may have useful permissions

# Windows
mountvol

# Linux
cat /etc/fstab # Drives mounted at boot time
mount # Currently mounted - Sys admins may have custom scripts that mount drives, which will not turn up in fstab
/bin/lsblk
```

### Enumerating Device drivers and kernel modules
```bash
# Windows Powershell
driverquery.exe /v /fo csv | ConvertFrom-CSV | Select-Object ‘Display Name’, ‘Start Mode’, Path
Get-WmiObject Win32_PnPSignedDriver | Select-Object DeviceName, DriverVersion, Manufacturer | Where-Object {$_.DeviceName -like "*VMware*"}

# Linux
lsmod # List loaded modules
/sbin/modinfo libata # Find out more about specific module
```

### Enumerating Binaries that autoelevate
```bash
# Windows
reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

# Linux
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```
# Automated Information Gathering
### Windows
*windows-privesc-check*, which can be found at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/windows-privesc-check).
```bash
windows-privesc-check2.exe --dump -G
```

### Linux
*unix_privesc_check*, which can be found [here](https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/audit/unix-privesc-check)
```bash
./unix-privesc-check standard > output.txt
```

# Topical Exercises
## Manual information gathering
2.  To solve this challenge, you need to enumerate the target VM #1, to help you determine the best approach for privilege escalation. To do so, you need to answer the questions by launching the _linux_enum_ binary in the _/challenge_ folder and get the flag.
	1. UID: 1000
	2. Non-system user: student
	3. OS: Kali GNU/Linux
	4. Architecture: x86_64
