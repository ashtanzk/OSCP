# CPU registers
## General Purpose Registers
Several registers, including EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, and EDI are often-used as general purpose registers to store temporary data. There is much more to this discussion (as explained in various online resources[2](https://portal.offensive-security.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/introduction-to-buffer-overflows/introduction-to-the-x86-architecture/cpu-registers#fn2)), but the primary registers for our purposes are described below:

-   EAX (accumulator): Arithmetical and logical instructions
-   EBX (base): Base pointer for memory addresses
-   ECX (counter): Loop, shift, and rotation counter
-   EDX (data): I/O port addressing, multiplication, and division
-   ESI (source index): Pointer addressing of data and source in string copy operations
-   EDI (destination index): Pointer addressing of data and destination in string copy operations
- ESP - The Stack Pointer (Points to the current stack)
	- As previously mentioned, the stack is used for storage of data, pointers, and arguments. Since the stack is dynamic and changes constantly during program execution, ESP, the stack pointer, keeps "track" of the most recently referenced location on the stack (**top of the stack**) by storing a pointer to it.
- EBP - The Base Pointer (Base pointer of the current stack frame)
	- Since the stack is in constant flux during the execution of a thread, it can become difficult for a function to locate its own stack frame, which stores the required arguments, local variables, and the return address. EBP, the base pointer, solves this by storing a pointer to the top of the stack when a function is called. By accessing EBP, a function can easily reference information from its own stack frame (via offsets) while executing.
- EIP - The Instruction Pointer
	- EIP, the instruction pointer, is one of the most important registers for our purposes as it always points to the **next code instruction to be executed**. Since EIP essentially directs the flow of a program, it is an attacker's primary target when exploiting any memory corruption vulnerability such as a buffer overflow.



# Buffer Overflow Walkthrough
We will anlayse a simple vulnerable application that **does not perform proper sanitisation of user input**. By analysing the application source code, we discover that we can pass a specifically crafter argument to the application, allowing us to copy our controlled input string to a smaller-sized stack buffer - giving us buffer overflow. This will lead to a return address overwrite as the overflow corrupts data on the stack, allowing us complete control over the EIP (Instruction pointer) register.

Controlling EIP is the **first step in creating a successful buffer overflow**.

## Sample Vulnerable code
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	char buffer[64];

	if (argc < 2)
	{
		printf("Error - You must supply at least one argument\n");
		
		return 1;
	}
	
	strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
	
  return 0;
}
```

The code consists of a *main* function, wiht a character array named *buffer* with size of 64 bytes on the stack. This space is reserved within the *main* function stack during the program execution.

The program then copies (strcpy) the content of the given argument into the *buffer* character array. At low level, a string in C is a sequence of characters terminated by a null byte ('\0'). 

At the end, the program terminates its execution a returns a zero (standard success exit cde) to the OS.

Since there are no checks on the size of the input, if we pass an argument with the size of less than 64 characters, the program will work as expected. But if we pass an argument with more than 64 characters, the part of the stack adjacent to the target buffer will be overwritten by the exceeding characters, overflowing the array boundaries.

# Topical Exercises
3.  To solve this challenge, you need to overflow the buffer of the bof-101 binary and cause a segmentation fault (you do not need to exploit this overflow). This binary is a slightly modified version of the "Sample Vulnerable Code" from section _10.2.1_, and you can access the source code of this binary once connected via SSH into VM #1.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define BUFSIZE 92

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char buffer[BUFSIZE];

  if (argc < 2)
  {
    printf("Error - You must supply at least one argument\n");

    return 1;
  }

  // some extra code to display the flag on a segfault redacted here

  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
  return 0;
}

```
```bash
./bof-101 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

4.  To solve this challenge, you need to find the flag inside _navigating-code.exe_ available on VM #2. Once downloaded the Windows executable, to find the flag, use the skills learned in this module to debug the code on your Windows client machine.
```bash
scp -P 2222 student@192.168.210.52:navigating-code.exe . # SCPs exe file from Linux VM #2 to local Kali

# Copy onto Windows 10 Lab Machine
```
	1. Open exe file in Immunity Debugger
	2. Right Click > Search for "All referenced text strings"
	3. Find the flag
OS{1c20d7a1195c9aec113e394945063c1c}

5.  On VM #3 you will find the _get-flag_ binary located in the _challenge_ folder which is going ask you four questions about CPU Registers. The flag to this challenge is will be returned if all the four questions are correctly answered with the 3-digit letters (AAA, BBB, CCC, etc.) corresponding to the 32-bit registers. These answers must all be capitalized.
	1. Which register allows a function to keep track of required arguments, local variables, and the return address?
		1. EBP
	2. Which register is a general purpose register that is often used to store the results of logical instructions?
		1. EAX
	3. Which register controls the execution flow of the program by storing the address of the next instruction to be executed?
		1. EIP
	4. Which register stores the lowest memory address (top) of the stack and is dynamic based on how much memory a function needs to store data, arguments, and pointers?
		1. ESP
