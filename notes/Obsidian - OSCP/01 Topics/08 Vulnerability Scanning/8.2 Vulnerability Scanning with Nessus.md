## Installing Nessus
Since Nessus is not available in the Kali repositories, we need to manually download the 64 bit **.deb** file from the Tenable website https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus
```bash
sudo apt install ./Nessus-X.X.X.deb
sudo /etc/init.d/nessusd start
```

Once Nessus is running, proceed to https://localhost:8834 to access the UI for Nessus.

We will be using Nessus Essentials. This product requires us to sign up with our email and get an activation code to activate and use Nessus.

## Defining Targets
We can select several scan types, but the basic network scan takes in the target machine's IP as input.

## Configuring Scan
We can also configure the scan types such as which ports to scan, whether TCP or UDP port scan, authenticated or unauthenticated scan etc.
