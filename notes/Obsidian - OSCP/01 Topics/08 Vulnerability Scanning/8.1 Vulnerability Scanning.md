## How do vulnerability scanners work
Vulnerability scanners can refer to both manual and automated scanning, and they usually follow a standard workflow in order to determine the security posture of the target, as well as to discover any potential vulnerabilities.

1. Detect if the target is up and running
2. Conduct a full or partial port scan - depends on the configuration
3. Identify the OS using common fingerprinting techniques
4. Attempt to identify running services with common techniques such as banner grapping, service behaviour identification, or file discovery
5. Execute a signature-matching process to discover vulnerabilities

During a manual assessment, we rely on recognising any vulnerabilties from the machine such as through a specific service version. For the automated scanning, the scanner relies on fingerprint matching, which can lead to more specific vulnerabilities being discovered.

## Manual vs Automated scanning
When should we use manual vs automated scanning?

Manual scanners can be very time-consuming and resource-intensive, since this involves human interaction and repetitive tasks. It is also prone to errors. However, in situations such as pen testing, where we may require surgical precision and a minimal network footprint, it can be good to make use of a manual approach.

Automated scanners, on the other hand, are very efficient at working on a large engagement with many targets. This can help us to quickly generate the baseline security posture of the network in a short amount of time.

However, automated scanners sometimes involve brute forcing passwords, which can lead to acocunt lock-outs, resulting in downtime for the target machine.
