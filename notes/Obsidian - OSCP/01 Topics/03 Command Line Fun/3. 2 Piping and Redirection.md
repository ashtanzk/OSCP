## Redirecting to a file

```bash
echo "This will overwrite an existing file" > outfile.txt
```

* Append to exisiting files
```bash
echo "This will append to an existing file" >> outfile.txt
```

## Redirecting from a file

* Take data from file as input to command
```bash
wc -m < infile.txt
# In this case, the wc -m command counts characters in a file
```
***
## Redirecting STDERR

- According to the POSIX specification, there are 3 file descriptors for STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR (0,1 and 2 respectively)
```bash
ls ./test 2>error.txt
# This will take the error you get when running ./test and outputs it to error.txt
```

***
## Piping
- We can use piping to redirect the output of one command to another command
- Commonly used for *grep*
```bash
cat error.txt | wc -m > count.txt
# This takes the output of the cat command on error.txt, and redirects it to the wc command, before finally writing the output of the wc command to count.txt
```
