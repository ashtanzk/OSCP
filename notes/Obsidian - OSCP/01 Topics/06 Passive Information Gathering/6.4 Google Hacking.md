## What is Google Hacking?
Here, Google Hacking refers to making use of **operators** to narrow down the search results.

For example, we can combine operators to locate PHP files on a particular site
```
# Search term on google.com
site:megacorpone.com filetype:php
```

We can also make use of the **-** operator to exclude particular results
```
# Search term on google.com
site:megacorpone.com -filetype:html
```

We can also look for pages which contain "index of" or "parent directory" in the title
```
# Search term on google.com
intitle: "index of" "parent directory"
```
