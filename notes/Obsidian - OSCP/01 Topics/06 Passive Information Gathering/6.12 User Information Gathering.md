## Email Harvesting
We will make use of a tool called **_theHarvester_** which will gather emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs from multiple data sources.
```bash
theHarvester -d megacorpone.com -b google
# -b indicates the datasources to be used
```

## Password Dumps
Password dumps can also be found only in websites such as Pastebin. These usually originate from data breaches, and can be valuable for generating wordlists.
