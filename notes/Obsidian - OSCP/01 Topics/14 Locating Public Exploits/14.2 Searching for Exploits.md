# Online Resources
1. **The Exploit Database**
The Exploit Database is a project maintained by Offensive Security, which is a free archive of public exploits.
https://www.exploit-db.com/

2. **SecurityFocus Exploit Archives**

# Offline Resources
1. **SearchSploit**
The Exploit Database provides a downloadable archived copy of all the hosted exploit code, which is included by default in Kali under the *exploitdb* package. It is recommended to update this package.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install exploitdb

ls -1 /usr/share/exploitdb/ # Splits into two major sections: exploits and shellcodes

ls -1 /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/ # Exploits are split across OS, architecture and scripting language
```

Manually searching across the files for exploits is not the easiest way to use, instead we can make use of the *searchsploit* utility from the command line.
```bash
searchsploit
# Usage: searchsploit [options] term1 [term2] ... [termN]

searchsploit remote smb microsoft windows # Example search
```

2. **Nmap NSE scripts**
The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) comes with various scripts for exploits, and they can be found under */usr/share/nmap/scripts*. We can use grep to search for "Exploits" to quickly return the results.
```bash
cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts
grep Exploits *.nse
```

3. **Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)**
This is a penetration testing tool focused on client-side attacks within the web browser.
```bash
sudo beef-xss
```
Once that is launched, browser t o *http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel* using the default credentials beef:beef to log in.

# Topical Exercises
1.  Connect to your dedicated Linux client and start the vulnerable Apache James service using the _/usr/local/james/bin/run.sh_ script.
2. Enumerate the target using port scanning utilities and use information from the banners and Internet searches to determine the software running on the machine.

7.  An exploitable server is running services on several ports on the exercise VM #2. Treat this like a real box and start by identifying what services are running on your assigned ports (and your ports only). There is a local user _student_ on this box with the password _lab. Exploit the vulnerable service and SSH to the box to read _flag.txt_ located in _/home/challenge_
	1. 192.168.232.52
	2. `sudo nmap 192.168.232.52 -p- -sV -vv --open --reason`
```
