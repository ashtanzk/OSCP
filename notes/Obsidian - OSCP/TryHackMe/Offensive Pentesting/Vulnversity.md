## Nmap
Use `nmap -sV <IP>` to get a quick version + services scan running on the target. This can be a quick way to determine any services vulnerabilities to exploit and explore from.

In order to make sure that all ports are being scanned, we can add `-p-XXX` to scan up to XXX ports.

## Gobuster
Gobuster can be used for directory discovery on websites, for shell upload and compromise.
