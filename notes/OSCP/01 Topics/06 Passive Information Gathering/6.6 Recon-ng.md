## Recon-ng
This is a module-based framework for web-based information gathering, displaying the results to the terminal but also storing them in a database.

By installing and using modules from the marketplace, we can compile interesting data on a site

```bash
marketplace search <keyword>

marketplace install <module name>

modules load <module name>

options set SOURCE megacorpone.com # Sets the source for the module to use
