## Domain Name System (DNS)
DNS is responsible for translating user-friendly domain names into IP addresses.

From your browser, the hostname (megacorpone.com) is passed to the OS's DNS client, which forwards the request to the configured DNS server (DNS recursor). This DNS recursor is responsible for interacting with the DNS infrastructure and returning the results to the client.

The DNS recursor looks for the TLD (.com) DNS server, and queries it for the address of the authoritative nameserver for the megacorpone.com domain. The results are then returned to the client, allowing you to locate the IP address of the web server, viewing the web page.

### DNS records
- _NS_ - Nameserver records contain the name of the authoritative servers hosting the DNS records for a domain.
- _A_ - Also known as a host record, the "_a record_" contains the IP address of a hostname (such as www.megacorpone.com).
- _MX_ - Mail Exchange records contain the names of the servers responsible for handling email for the domain. A domain can contain multiple MX records.
- _PTR_ - Pointer Records are used in reverse lookup zones and are used to find the records associated with an IP address.
- _CNAME_ - Canonical Name Records are used to create aliases for other host records.
- _TXT_ - Text records can contain any arbitrary data and can be used for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification.

### Automating forward lookups
```bash
cat list.txt # Create wordlist for bruteforcing
# www
# ftp
# mail
# owa
# proxy
# router

for ip in $(cat list.txt); do host $ip.megacorpone.com; done
# www.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.76
# Host ftp.megacorpone.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
# mail.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.84
# Host owa.megacorpone.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
# Host proxy.megacorpone.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
# router.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.71```
```

### Automating reverse lookups
```bash
# Using loop to scan IP addresses 38.100.193.50 through 38.100.193.100
for ip in $(seq  50 100); do host 38.100.193.$ip; done | grep -v "not found"
# 69.193.100.38.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer beta.megacorpone.com.
# 70.193.100.38.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer ns1.megacorpone.com.
# 72.193.100.38.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer admin.megacorpone.com.
# 73.193.100.38.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer mail2.megacorpone.com.
# 76.193.100.38.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer www.megacorpone.com.
# 77.193.100.38.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer vpn.megacorpone.com.
```

### Zone Transfers
A zone transfer is basically a database replication between DNS servers, essentially listing out all the network layout if allowed.
```bash
# host -l <domain name> <dns server address>
host -l megacorpone.com ns2.megacorpone.com
```

## Tools
- **DNSrecon**
```bash
dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -t axfr

# Given input list.txt for bruteforcing
dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -D ~/list.txt -t brt

# Zone transfer
dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -a
```
- **DNSenum**
```bash
dnsenum zonetransfer.me
```
